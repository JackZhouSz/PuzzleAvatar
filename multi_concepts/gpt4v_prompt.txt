Analyze the provided images, each featuring an individual. Identify and describe the individual's gender, facial features (excluding hair), haircut, and specific garments like shirts, hats, pants, shoes, dresses, skirts, scarves, etc. Return the results in a dictionary format as follows: {"gender": gender, "face": facial description, "haircut": hair description, "shirt": shirt description, "dress": dress description, "skirt": skirt description, "pants": pants description, "eyeglasses": eyeglasses description, "shoes": shoes description, ...}. The "description" should be one or two noun/adj words that describe the topological or geometric features, such as length (short/long), shape or style, without referencing color or texture pattern. Exclude accessories like belts, watch, badges, and etc. Remove the key if the garment does not appear, or the value string is empty (""), only keep the visible garments, do not describe colors, and ensure no garment is described within the description of another (e.g., {"pants": "long dress"}). All strings should be enclosed in double quotes. The response should only contain the dictionary, without additional sentences, explanations, or markdowns.
